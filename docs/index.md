### **Yifan's garden**

Here stores my personal thoughts and articles. The name 'Yifan's garden' is from a record movie called [Le jardin de Celibidache](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0148351/). That movie focused on [Sergiu Celibidache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergiu_Celibidache), which is my favourite conductor.
